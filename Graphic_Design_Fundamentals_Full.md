<br>

>The basic elelments of graphic design are:

<br>

### Denotative Imagemaking

* Denotated images are of the subject itself, it is what the subject is, but has meaning conveyed through our application of it.

In the case of drawing an Apple to represent an Apple, have we use a color pallate that lends itself to the apple looking healthy or sickly? Sliced or intact? Green for Grannysmith or Red for Delicious?

The designer adds extra information to the subject, and communicates that information to the viewer, molding their perception of the Apple and influencing their decisions regarding it.

* A lot of what denotative imaging about is trying to strip the image down and get at what is it's core value, our picture of an empty glass on white backdrop is just that, the glass, and nothing more or less.

* Our first consideration should be "What is the essence of this object?"

What conveys the essence of our Apple?

Shape, color, texture, proportions, size, and it has certain elements that allow it to be recognized as an Apple, and not something else.

* The apple cut in half is very different in it's essence, yet remains exactly the same, and instantly recognizable.

The center of all apples is a vertically oriented core, housing black seeds, of which has a top and bottom dimple, with a stem attaching to the top one.

Broken down into a Slice instead, the apple is still instantly recognizable by all of the same features that we could see from the half(except maybe the stem)

* The Apple exists in life in many various states, segmented, whole, juiced, baked, sliced etc.

Our job as a designer is to come up with how we are going to communicate this essence to the audience.

A disproportionate Red Apple, which is too round in shape, coupled with a long stalk, will be confused with a cherry to the audience; this is a poor communication of the Apple's essence, even though it's basic attributes are still that of an Apple.

The designer's job is to control these things, and take those which may make the subject mean something to the audience, and make them mean the things that we want them to.

* We can also deliberately mix these messages, and use them to our advantage. A perfect looking Apple is sliced in half, but inside it looks exactly like a Lemon, you think of a citrus Sour Apple, because the primary subject is the Apple, and the secondary was the Lemon.

How about the reverse? What would a Lemon cut in half, revealing an Apple convey?

<br>

#### Realistic VS Iconic Denotative Images

These are differentated from eachother by the level of detail. The outline of the shape of the Apple (especially with a bite taken out of it) is Iconic. It is simple, it is the apple in it's most basic recognizable form.

A 3D rendered Apple, wrapped with a photo derived texture is very Realistic, but it is not iconic; these are conceptual opposites.

In the same light, an Icon will never be thought of as realistic, nor will a 3D rendered Apple be considered an Icon, yet both are instantly recognizable as the same thing that they both are, an Apple.

* The Designer gets to decide in what way to apply this Denotative Image, to convey it at it's essence in the desired way.

Should it be in an Iconic and simplistic way, so a corporate logo that needs to be read and processed very fast by the viewer can be; or should it be highly detailed and photo realistic for decorative mural?

<br>

### Connotative Imagemaking

* Connotative Images are created through the combination of another element with the image in order to connotate a meaning that would otherwise not be present.

Our Apple being labelled 'AAA+' makes us assume it is of high grade, or an apple with blue wavy lines infront of it makes us think that it is in water.

Maybe the apple is half green and half red, and is interpreted like the yin-yang, or maybe it is coiled by a serpent making the viewer think of the snake of Eden instead of a random pairing of fruit and animal.

* Context can plays a factor when creating Connotative images.

Context is often cultural or social.

Consider the example of a picture of a boy's head with an apple on top of it, which has an arrow going through the apple; if you are from the west, then this will bring to mind the story of William Tell, and if not, then it could be taken as quite random and perplexing.

* Since not everyone reads the same images in the same way, part of the designer's job is to try and control the messages that are being converyed to the target audience, while considering how else they might be read.

* Controlling Connotation is really about *controlling meaning*.

Take Apple inc. and ask yourself how many people would look at that logo and actually think of an actual Apple, as opposed to the tech company?

Apple inc has done nothing to indicate that the Apple has anything to do with technology, or a company, it's merely an apple missing a bite, though they control the meaning to such an extent that they have taken the icon's natural identity.

<br>

## Typography in Design

---

Typography is one of the most important things to grasp in Design.

Design is about communication, about how we communicate through words and through pictures; and how we use them together.

<br>

### Typography Vocabulary

* Letterforms are how an individual letter is drawn

This, as was originally done with a quill, is composed of strokes(of the pen).
The composition of the letterform has it's own vocabulary for it's various parts.

Using the letter 'a' as an example, the curve on the bottom right of the letter is called the *Bowl*. The letter 'a' is made with two strokes, the second of which is exclusively the bowl, and the first stroke, which starts at the top right corner of the 'a' as the little hook part, is called the *Terminal*, flowing into and down the back of the letter; which is known as the *stem*, to the foot of the letter, known as the *Spur*; and the empty space between the *Bowl and the Stem* it known as the *Counterspace*.

> Stroke 1 = Terminal(the head), Stem(the spine), Spur(the heels)

> Stroke 2 = Bowl(the gut)

> Space between the strokes = Counterspace (empty inside space)

* Letterform parts are often described directly in relation to the parts of the human body, with common assumption being the context.

 The top bulge of the capital R may be referred to as 'the Shoulder'; the serifs on the Spurs of a letter 'K' as it's 'Foot', and the upper stalk as it's 'Arm'; the center portion of an 'S' curve as 'the Spine'; the gap in the top portion of the lowercase 'e' as the 'eye'.

<br>

#### Word vocabulary

* **Baseline** The invisible line upon which the letters of a word sit is called the *Baseline*. This is positioned as you'd see a line on a piece of paper, with the bottom parts of a lowercase 'p' or 'y' dipping below it, but all capital letters always sitting exactly on top of it.

* **Leading** is the space from baseline to baseline; the lines on a piece of paper

* **X-Height** the lowercase 'x' serves as the base size for all lowercase letters, so it's height is measured and used to relate the other accompannying typeface lower-case letters to a size conformity

* **Cap-height** is the height that a standard capital letter within the typeface should be

* **Ascender and Descender** are the pieces of a lowercase letter that go above, or dip below the typeface's X-height, respectively

<br>

#### Spacing

The space between letters(letter spacing, or *Kerning*) and the space between words(word spacing) are communulatively known as the *'Tracking'*

* Type has it's own unique measuring system called **Point Size**

This is derived from the old days of the printing press where each letter was fixed upon a metal backing, and the size of that backing onto which the letters were conformed to fit came in specific sizes, which were differentated by their *Point Size* number.

What then, is a "point"?

* A point is 1/72 of an inch

This was determined as a mathematical convienence in the days of the printing press, as metal casting of both upper and lower cases of each letter of the alphabet must be made for every size and typeface to be used, and this system allowed for the most mathematical congruence between these mediums in those times.

This is why 12pt type size is still the standard size for regular print, and 24 for a small heading, because that casting is exactly 2x larger

<br>

##### What certain sizes were traditionally used for

* Headlines: 120pt, 96pt, 72pt, and 48pt

* Subheads: 36pt and 24pt

* Standard text: 9pt to 12pt

* Footnotes: 6pt and 8pt

<br>

### Text Alignment

* Range Left: When text is conformed to the left margin of a page, but is not constrained on the right

> Range left text should have 12-15 words per line, or 60-70 characters

* Justified: When text is even between both the left and right margins, forming more of a square look to the text

> Justified text should have 9-12 words per line, or 70-80 characters

Range left is a little more natural to read than Justified. Often, a storybook will be in range left, and often a legal document will appear Justified

<br>

### How to Choose a Typeface

* "Roman = Regular": 'Times New Roman' has meant 'Times Regular' this entire time, who knew?

A regular typeface means that nothing has been done to the text, and it is appearing as standard; straight, not bold or italic, with proportionate spacing

* **Font vs Typeface**, when spoken in design terms rather than computer slang have two separate meanings. The *Font* would be the entire paramaters of the type that is used, including the size; which may look something like "The *Font* is Times New Roman-Bold 32pt".

The *Typeface* is to describe only that part of the equation, so the *Typeface* used in our *Font* above is New Roman

* **Serif vs Sans-serif** sometimes needs to be explained to people who have no experience using word proccessing computer programs or other forms of typography, and this is best done by explaining what a Serif is.

A Serif is the piece of accentuation, or extra strokes that are added onto a letter, such as the feet on a capital A; since "Sans" is French for "without", we can understand that "Sand-Serif" means 'Plain', or "without the accentuating Serif strokes added".

> Serifs originally came from chisel marks when words used to be carved into stone, and had then evolved into various decorative forms

Serifs come in 4 different base styles: Old Style, Transitional, Modern, and Egyptian

* *Old Style* has limited contrast between thick and thin strokes, meaning the thick, and the thin parts are close to the same size. They also have a diagonal stress between where the thick and thin areas of the characters are. For example, the letter O's thinner points will at the top-left and the bottom-right

* *Transitional* has slightly more contrast between the thick and the thin strokes when compared to *Old Style*. The thin areas are *more thin* and so make these typefaces feel more airy and delicate than Old Style. Their stress points, or thin areas are more central, and are oriented upon the vertical axis

* *Modern* is not actually modern at all, and date back to the 17th century. These have straighter serifs, and a high contrast between thick and thin strokes; the thin strokes are ectremely thin

* *Egyptian* Has no contrast between the thick and thin strokes, nor is there any contrast between the strokes and the serifs. The Typeface is exaxtly uniform in thickness

Sans-Serifs come in 3 major categories: Grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist

* *Grotesque* are simple, but still slightly irregular forms, made with an even stroke

* *Geometric* have a perfectly round O, and as the name implies, has a geometric proportionality to it's characters, and it has a very clean, uniform, and modern feeling

* *Humanist* looks as if there is a hint of handwriting, stalks onto which a serif could be placed but opting not to; or as to the namesake 'Humanist', pen strokes within the characters; the letter O is not perfectly round, but has a slight squaring to it's proportions

<br>

### Weight and Width

* **Weights** come in the following standards, from thickest to lightest: Extra Black, Black, Bold, Roman/Normal, and Light

* **Widths** from most compact to most spread out: Thin-Ultra Condensed, Ultra Condensed, Condensed, Roman/Normal, and Extended

<br>

### How we Read Typography

The two parts of read type are the **Denotation** and the **Connotation**: The pragmatic function of the type, as in, what the type actually says; and the *Feeling or Expression* of the type, or how it looks combined with the wording of the phrases.

Controlling both of these aspects of Typography is what makes a good Typographer.

* Typeography Denotation: Breaking down the nuts and bolts

Take the task of selecting a Typeface for a Museum:

* Serif vs Sans: A Serif choice feels more like a Historic Museum; Sans-serif more like a contemporary Scientific Museum, due to what we know of the connotations of serif and sans-serif typefaces. Since our example museum will be the latter, let's go with sans-serif.

* Family: Once the decision has been made to go with sans-serif, we then consider the functionality that we are looking for in from the typeface.

We want to use this typeface for a wide variety of applications, from banners, to signage, to programs; so it is important that we select a typeface that provides us with a large family to choose from when creating our various projects; something bold for our banners, something Extended for our cafeteria signs, something extra-light for our gift cards etc.

> For an example of the other side of the fence: If this were for an off-branded cafe stand within the museum, then we would be fine with a much smaller family

* How does it read at different sizes?

Do we need it to be readable in a very small, or very large size, and if so, how does it look?

* How to choose which is best from your short list?

Well, this one is going to be by feel after all considerations, but the best way to tell the subtle differences between typefaces is to take a few letters from each, blow them up large, and then make them both a semi transparent layer of middle gray, and a thin, different colored stroke for each, then place one over top of the other to see the fine differences between them.

The areas where they differ will be lighter gray than the areas which they are the same, which will be dark.

* Controlling the connotation of our typeface will be the final factor in our choice. Using the words "Fat" and "Fast", it's easy to picture that a condensed and bold typeface is going to suit Fat more than it would suit Fast, and a San-serif Modern typeface would suit Fast better than it would Fat.

<br>

### Usage example: A Personal Brand

Our client is "John Painterman". Let's see a few scenarios in which we might use Typeface to influence our client's perception:

* John is an old-timey pillar of the community who paints houses

We would want to go with something that looks classic, and straight-forward

* John is decorative painter

Perhaps a more modern font would be suitable here, where the letters feel less rigid and a little more flowing, like strokes made with a paintbrush

* John is an Artistic painter

Here we likely want to go with something that is very Modern and Humanist, that looks like it was created with a calligraphy pen, or a fine paint brush

* John paints Abstract Modern-Art

Choosing a wild, yet clean and geometric typeface would be quite fitting in this case

> Notice how these things don't mix well with eachother, when you really think about it; an old-timey hard working house painter isn't likely writing fine caligrapgy after work, and likewise, a professional Artist is likely not going to choose a plain printing-house look to represent themselves.

#### We can also use *Scale* and *Composition* to influence our message

Maybe we don't have the luxury of choosing from a variety of typefaces, or maybe we just want to use more tools than solely that.

* By the ways that we arrange words, or variations in the scale and compositon of letters within words, more influence can be leveraged. For example "Big I in Mississippi" may be stylized with case to emphasize the I, as " BIg I In MIssIssIppI"

* Using the word "Architecture" you could arrange the letters in point size to resemble the building up of a staircase with A at 9pt, R at 10pt, C at 11pt, and the rest, tecture at 12pt; conveying the idea of making something large from the ground-up

* Again using the same word, you could case it as archITecTure to give the allusion to buildings within the text; skyscrapers among the cityline (with a bonus subliminal of IT conveying technical know-how)

## Designing a Typographic Monogram (and a Business-Card)

A monogram is a design based on the initials of your First and Last name

* Begin by creating a page that has various iterations of your initials, each with a different typeface applied, changing them as the feeling strikes you, while you use this as a muse for inspiration

* What ranges or forms of letters can you see that may be interesting to work with?

Might some of the cursive ones look well beside eachother, or perhaps some of the serif ones would lend themselves nicely to over-lapping?

Make a shortlist of finalists that you like

* Set this list aside, and then start taking your parings and playing with them, and while doing so, if you come across anthing that you like, copy it and save it to a "maybe" section.

Try taking the first pair and moving the kerning closer and further, see if it creates an impression that you like; maybe they will overlap nicely?

What if one of them is flipped or rotated?

One small, one large?

Mirror imaged?

Just begin to play and save, and don't spend too much time on any particular literation; this is a brainstorming stage!

* Take your basic business card text (Printed Name, E-mail, Phone Number) and have an iteration put aside with  a plain Typeface for easy copy-pasting

What you want to do is to then make a few copies of this, using different typefaces that might feel right for representing you, ans then set those aside to use for visual comparison with your Monograms.

* Make a page of blank business card templates, and set them aside for easy copy-pasting

Using these, place your basic text inside, and expiriment with various positions and text alignments.

Then, once again make a short list of contenders which you may(or may not) want to use

* Try pairing various iterations from your Monogram shortlist with those from your Business Card short-list

...And you guessed it, make a shortlist of any combinations that you may like, or want to further expiriment with

* Select a finalist

Tweak it, and refine it, add some color if you wish, and now you have a basic Monogram Business Card!

## Fundamentals of Shape and Color

---

### Graphic Shapes

This is a look into how designers use shape and form.

* A shape is really a line that is made to be a closed path, so to stop seeing a line and start seeing shape and form, the line must be closed, and then filled; either by empty space, or with color, or both

We start by looking at the three basic shapes, which will typify the diresction in which all other shapes will have: Square, Triangle, and Circle

Using the shapes in groups, our minds like to try to read them in abstract form, take 2 circles positioned as eyes, a triangle as nose, and a square as mouth; it's instantly recognizable as a face.

* Small adjustments to shape can have a large effect on how we interpret them together. Take our face, if it had a half circle for a mouth with the cut half up, it would appear to smile; flipped it would appear to frown, and if flipped and moved up, it would look worried

#### Visual Contrast and Shapes

* The most basic way of applying contrast to a shape is *with the shape* itself.

A small circle and a large circle is a contrast in size. One perfect, another oblong is a contrast in proportion, one red and one pink is a contrast in color.

* Another primary contrast would be *how the object **feels in space***

Is it Vertical(high) or Horizontal(low)? Or, maybe when the horizontal is placed above the vertical line, is it vertical(high) and horizontal(higher)?

* **Narrow or Broad** it's the same in one dimension of space, but thinner/wider in the other

* **Direction and Movement** might be conveyed; a large square on the baseline of a scene will be seen as solid and unmoving, where a few thin lines at an angle above will be seen as falling.

How about several squares stacked like stairs? We associate stairs with ascent so this would also have movement.

Each solitary shape will have movement as well.

A diagonal line '/' the eye will follow from bottom to top across the horizontal plane and the vertical plane; giving that basic shape a sense of movement as compared to a square, which will be a central gaze; the eye will not need to follow the shape anywhere, so the square will have a solid feeling.

* What is the **Relationship between Light and Heavy**?

The **Shading**: Is it Dark or Light or Neutral?

The **Stroke(Outline)**: Is it *soft*(slightly blurred/anti-aliased) or is it *Hard*(Crisp and Precise)?

* **Line VS Volume** or Stroke Vs Fill; in which way is the shape primarily being described?

Is it an empty(white on white) circle with a thin and black outline? Or, is it a solid Blue circle with no outline?

Maybe a Black Square with a Hard black stroke? In that case, it would be primarily Volume, but what if that stroke was dark-red and soft? Now, the Line has taken prominence.

### Marks, Icons, and Symbols

Now that Shapes have been covered, it's appropriate to mention that all Shapes are Marks.

* Graphic Marks are generally devoid of meaning, so they hold no connotation, only denotation,; so they are the equivalent of a denotative form.

In other words, circle+square+triangle = circle+square+triangle, every time.

There is nothing to be read about the forms other than the forms themselves.

* Icons and Symbols represent other things:

* **Icon**: Represents something in pictoral form

Are: Pictoral, Representative of Actual Things, and are Easy to Read

These are intuitive and tend to communicate their face value at a glance.

For example: An icon of an Envelope, or a Telephone Reciever

* **Symbol**: Represents something more abstract, like an idea or a construct

Are: Non-Pictoral, Represents Ideas or Products, and these are Learned/Coded

You can't figure out what a symbol means just by looking at it, you have to learn what it means by being told.

For example: A Dollar Sign $, or the at-symbol @

* Icons and Symbols both have a simplified form, which is the thing they have in common which causes people to confuse the termonology of the two, but they are indeed quite different

Because of the nature of symbols, they differ between region and how they are used. Take a mathematical plus symbol, and color it red; in the west that means First-aid or Hospital, but if you put extra length onto the bottom of it, it now becomes the Christian symbol of the Knights Templar, take away that color and it's now a generic Christian cross.

#### Shades and Depth

* Depth and the ability to create it relies heavily on tonality

Consider how on a black background, a solid white object will appear closer than a dark gray object, because our real life sight tends to work this way.
The Same is true with a reversal of shades where a black object appears closer than a light gray on a white background.

* Manipulating the shades and proportions of objects in relation to eachother will subsequently manipulate their precieved depths within the scene

### Color

* Our primary response to color is an **Emotional** one, due largely to the color world that we live in

*On top of that emotional response, however is a **Subjective** one

We all have our own personal associations with color such as our favourites, the memories attached, such as the color of our first car, or the walls in our sibling's bedroom vs our own growing up.

* There is a **Scientific** or *Technical* response

This would be the strategic associations colors have, often the types of things that a designer might think about such as which colors go with which others and why, what temperatures the colors are, what numerical values they have; what their individual attributes and components are

* We have a **Connective response** as well

Might something in the color represent something in the real world?

Does Red = stop, or does a yellow circle high on a blue canvas represent the Sun?

If the bottom half of the page is green, and the top is blue, are we looking at a representation of grass and the sky?

### Hue and Saturation

* **Saturation** is the *vibrance* of the color, or the amount of shade(black or white) within the color. A color with no black or white added to it is a pure color and at it's most vibrant, and a color that has a large amount of white, black, or gray added to it will appear dull, or less vibrant.

* **Hue** references any color on the wheel that is pure, and so has a maximum amount of saturation

#### Color Value Terminology

* **Value** is the amount of shade within the saturation, or another way to think of it would be the intensity of gray on a grayscale where 100 is pure white and 0 is pure black

* **Shade** is the amount of *Black* added to the color. **Hue + Black = Shade**

* **Tint** is the amount of *White* added to the color. **Hue + White = Tint**

* **Tone** is the amount of *Gray*(a mixture of white and black) added to the color **Hue + Gray = Tone**

> Use example: If I were to say "A shade of Blue" I mean some sort of a darker Blue, and if I say "it has a Blue tint" I mean a lighter shade of Blue; but if I say "It's a blue tone" I am implying that a dark wash as well as a light wash have been added to the color. A "Gray-ish Blue" description could only be of a Tone.

<br>

## Composition

In a nutshell, composition is arranging everything on the page.

A Photographer took the picture, an Illustrator made the graphic, a Typesetter made the type, and a copywriter wrote the text; so what did the designer do?

The *Designer did the Composition*.

* The **Compositon** can make or break the message that the piece is trying to communicate

Using a room with a table and chairs as an example, if all the chairs were arranged neatly at the table, the table would appear ready for use; but if those same chairs were instead on top of the table, it would appear to be in a state of off-limits for maintainence.

How about 8 folding chairs on a carpet: Arranged in a row, you would assume that it was for an audience; arranged in a circle, and you would assume that this is for a group meeting; both are giving the entire room a very different feeling as a conquence.

Just by arranging the chairs in different ways, you can make the room appear welcoming, boring, cluttered, disorginized, uncomfortable, or unwelcome; and this is the art of **Composition**

* **Compisition** is putting together any, or all of the elements of design into a scene, with *thoughtful intent* in order to create messages and aesthetics

### The Rule of Thirds

This is a principal of Photography, but also applies to any Composition.

If you take a scene and divide it into 3rds (two even horizontal lines, and two even vertical lines) the points where these lines intersect are the *Points of Visual Interest*; they are where the eyes will go first when looking at a picture, or a scene.

* We want our subjects of focus to cross one or more of these points.

When it comes to framing, we also want to use these lines for **Horizontal and Vertical symmetry**

For example, if on a landscape, the Horizon would best line up with one of the Horizontal lines, and the beginning/end of a wall of trees in the shot would best start/end at one of the Vertical lines

### The Golden Rectangle

This is applying the Golden Ratio to a rectangle. This shape is of course more circular, being a sort of a spiral; so starting at the margin, you would figure out what is the maximum size that you could make a perfect Golden Ratio(Fibonacci Spiral) on this page?

This can be hacked by seeing which point on the page a vertical line could be drawn that would make one half of the space a *Perfect Square*, as the first half of a Fibonacci Spiral always conforms to a perfect square.

* Draw the line to make a **Perfect Square**

* Draw a vertical line directly down the middle of the square

* From either of the top corners of the square, draw a **Straight, Diagonal Line** from the corner, to the bottom of the vertical line in the center of the square

* Use this point as the center radius of a circle that perfectly encases the entirety of the square

The Rectangle and Square combination that is left on the page is now seen to perfectly conform to the proportions of the Fibonacci Spiral, and so, can be repeated from here ad-infitium.

> Really though, we have achieved what we needed to achieve as soon as we made the line that created the perfect square

Once one **Perfect Square** has been created, within the remaining rectangular space, repeat the process and make another **Perfect Square**, which this time will be along the *Vertical Axis*, and continue until your scene has been divided into a layout that you are happy with using.

This can be seen in the layouts of many classical publications, and many magazines

> Imagine the first iteration being for a Large Square Picture and a Rectangle of Text.

> Imagine a second iteration Having a Sub-Picture above the text, which is beside the Large Square Picture.

> Imagine a third iteration having a Sub-picture with it's own sub-text, placed above the text which is beside the Large Square Picture.

### Visual Contrast

This is another way of describing what is going on "under the hood" with Composition.

It is the visual differences between shapes, tones, colors, sizes, placement, and everything else; as relating to eachother in the scene.

**Visual Contrast** can be broken down into 6 different categories:

**Form, Scale, Weight, Space, Direction, and Texture**

These should be largely self expainatory by now, and this contrast isn't particularily important, it's just something that we are aware of that we can manipulate.

What is important, is the **Visual Heirarchy** within the image

### Visual Heirarchy

Understanding **Visual Heirarchy** is very important for designers because this will dictate the subject and messages of our scenes.

* Where does the viewer's **Eye Travel**?

We want to control the flow of attention when the viewer looks at the scene; we want to predict where they will look and in what sequence.

* What are the entry points of focus in the image? Where are the vanishing points in the image? How long does the gaze linger on focal points within the image, and which ones?

* **Cropping** is a big part in helping a designer control the perception of an image because it allows us to dictate the **Frame** in which the scene is presented

## Usage Terminology

* **Fonts are created** as .ots or .tts files, and consist of vector information for every single letter and every single symbol, in Bold, Italic, Other weights, and this includes *all* special symbols for use in languages other than English.

As such, creating a Font is actually a massive amount of work of which may be copyrighted by it's creators, so always check licencing before using a Font.

* The forms used within the typographic alphabet emerged from scribes using caligriphic pens in the 16th century. This is why we have things such as "stroke" and "weight".

* **Stroke** is the look of the lines

* **Weight** is the uniform thickness of the strokes

* **Modulation** is how much the thickness of the strokes differs between different parts of each letter (think of the corners of the letter O). In actual caligraphy, the pen is held at an angle, which naturally creates strokes with a lot of modulation

* **Modulated Typefaces appear** a little more *"Sparkly"* across the page, whereas less modulated typefaces appear more even

* **The Axis** of the Modulation, or the Slope, is the tilt of the modulation in the strokes.

In more Modulated typefaces the **Axis** tends to be more angular, whereas on less modulated typefaces the axis tends to be more vertical

* **Serif = Easier to read** is what some type designers argue, as the serifs create an imaginary line in which the letters sit on, making it easier to follow with the eye.

For this reason, Serif has generally been seen as *More Appopriate for **Long Bodies of Text***

* Typefaces with a **Smaller X-Height** will appear more delicate and deliberate across the page, while a larger **X-Height** will appear more bold, sturdy, and even

* **The Body** is the backing of the physical, or non-physical block onto which the letter to be printed has been cast, thus comprising the whitespace surrounding any given character.

The *Height of the Body* is where we come up with the measurement for **Point Size**, which equates to 72 Points per square Inch

* **Picas (pc)** Picas are the next unit above **Points (pt)**, and there are **6 Picas in an Inch**

The **Notation for** 6 Picas and 3 Points is written as "6p3"

* **The Counter** is the part of the typeface that is visible which is not the stroke, in otherwords, it's the whitespace of the **Body** surrounding the letter

Because the counter is larger than the type, typeographers argue that when reading at small scale, our brains are recognizing the **Counter** of the keys, rather than the actual strokes

* **Metrics** is the term for describing the set of invisible lines which are being used to define a typeface, such as "Cap height: 7pt + X-height: 4pt + Ascender Height: 0.5pt + Descender height: 0.3pt"

* **em** recognizable from it's wide usage in the programming language **CSS** is defined by *having the **Same Width** as the **Typeface's Body Height***

* **en** is a variant of an **em** but is ***Half** the size of an em*

<br>

## Choosing a Typeface

* **Legibility** should we be considering how easy one word can be read from the next, or is our choice purely artistic?

If the **Typeface is Small** we may want to consider choosing a **Large X-Height** so that the text is easier to read

* Typefaces that are **Specifically Designed for Screens**(such as Georgia) tend to have an extra large X-Height due to small text becoming pixelated

* **Aperture** in type is going to refer to the space in between groups of letters, so an *Open Aperature* will have each letter keeping itself as contained as possible, whereas a *closed Aperture* will have features that may poke out of some letters, such as a curved foot on the bottom of a lowercase "a", and a small gap in the letters "c" and "e".

When choosing a smaller font, especially for the screen, a **Closed Aperture** will be *Harder to read* than an *Open* one

### Balancing Typefaces

When choosing multiple Typefaces for a project, the trick to pairing is to effectively pair complimentary **Contrast** and **Consistency**

* Establish **Contrast** by choosing typefaces that are stylisticly different from one another, so that they are easily distinguishable.

It is for this reason that similar typefaces should generally not be paired, as this is largely redundant.

* Look for Typefaces with **Similar Proportions** as this way they will both generally fit within the same lines, kernings, and formatting

Start by comparing the **X-Height**, followed by the **Shapes of the Letters**; are their angles similar(both diagonal or both vertical with similar vertical aperture)?

### The Feel of a Typeface

* **Old-Style Serifs** are those that typically have *Bracketed Serifs*(long and curvy), a notably *Slanted Axis*, and a *Small X-Height*; These typefaces resemble those of the Classic Era Printing-Press, and originated in Germany, and was used in the first era of mass press production afterwards in Rome

* **Modern Serifs (Aka: "Didones")** have a **Vertical Axis**, **Un-Bracketed Serifs**, and they have **Strong Modulation**

Modern Serif Typefaces are seen as the last stage in the long tradition of Roman book Typography. This evolution went from a largely Humanist form (resembling hand-writing) to a largely non-humanist one, creating the basis for most of the typefaces that we use today.

* **Transitional Serifs** are Typefaces that are roughly *half-way between* Old-Style and Modern Serifs, having a **Vertical Axis**; but with **More Modulation** than Modern Serifs, and with **Bracketed Serifs**

* **Slab Serif (Egyptian)** Typefaces sport an *Industrial* look, with thick ***slab* serifs**, **Ball Terminals**, **Vertical Axis**, and a **Large X-height**  

> This typeface has nothing to do with Egypt or Egyptians, but was named as such due to the trend of posessing materials of foregin cultures being seen as exotic in the west at the time, and was named Egyptian in a misguided effort to appear trendy and desirable. Slab is a much more fitting name, as after all, Egyptian doesn't use type at all, but instead uses Heiroglyphs.

* **Geometric Sans-Serif** Typefaces have a **circular 'o'**, a **tail-less 't'**, a **single story 'a'**(which means shaped like an o + | rather than the cursive looking usual), and **an unmodulated stroke**

Geometric san-serifs are so called because of their geometric construction: the circles, triangles, and straight lines that form the core shapes of their letterforms.

Examples of Geometric typefaces include *DM Sans*, *Poppins*, and *Raleway*

* **Grotesk** Typefaces are simple, but still slightly irregular forms. They have a fairly *large X-height* and an *unmodulated stroke*

* **Neo-Grotesk** - Called a "Naturalist Sans-Setif" had it's first incarnation with **Helvetica** from the intention of *modernizing* and *cleaning up "Grotesk"* to create a new standard of typeface for **modern design**. It is a cleaner, and more mechanical looking update for Sans-Serif, which up until that time, appeared rather "quirky".

## Iconic Typefaces

* **Roman / New Roman** - The Classic, the first "proper" typeface for mass print on the printing presses. Roman is one of the three main kinds of historical type, alongside blackletter and italic. Sometimes called "normal".

* **Italic** - Historically, *Italics were a distinct style* of type used entirely separately from roman type, but they have come to be used in conjunction—most fonts now come with a roman type and an italic type. In this usage, Italics are a way to *emphasise key points* in a printed text, to *identify* many types of creative works, to *cite foreign words or phrases*, or, when *quoting a speaker*, a way to show which words they *stressed*. One manual of English usage described italics as **"the print equivalent of underlining"**

* **Helvetica** - Designed in **1957** in aspiration of becoming *The Generic Typeface*, it instead became *The American Corporate standard* considered to be the perfect medium typeface for any application; though today many post-modern designers would argue it's use to be "dated and stale", or "cliche' and boring".

**Helvetica is the DEFAULT TYPEFACE** for *city signage* almost everywhere, and remains the default font on *most electronic devices*, and *corporate signage* to this day.

Notable features of Helvetica as originally designed include a *high x-height*, the *termination of strokes* on horizontal or vertical lines and *an unusually tight spacing* between letters, which combine to give it a *dense, solid appearance*.

The name derives from Helvetia, the Latin name of Switzerland.

* **Blackletter(Gothic)** - Blackletter, also known as **Gothic script**, *Gothic minuscule*, or **Textura**, was a script used throughout Western Europe from approximately **1150 until the 17th century**.

* **Fette Fraktur** - *Blackletter typeface* of the sub-classification *Fraktur* (*Fraktur* and *blackletter* are sometimes used interchangeably) designed by the German punchcutter Johann Christian Bauer in **1850** and became taboo due to it's use in *Nazi propaganda*, though later resurfaced in *modern street art*

* **Neuland** - Designed in **1923** by Rudolf Koch, who designed it by directly carving the type into metal.

While originally intended as a form of *modern blackletter*, Neuland has come instead to be used as a signifier of the **“exotic”** or **“primitive”**, such as in the promotional materials for **The Lion King**, and the **Jurassic Park** films (which use the inline variant); controversially, this has included an association with **African** themes.

* **Bembo** - A *Serif* typeface created by the *Monotype* Corporation in **1928–1929** and most commonly *used for body text*

* **Clarendon** - A *contemporary **remake*** of the truly classic **slab serif** typeface with a distinctively *clear and legible* visibility. It is a *widely usable* text type suited for **distinction and style** without sacrificing **readability**.

* **Futura** - A geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner in 1927. It was designed as a contribution on the New Frankfurt-project(dedicated to international trends in architecture, art, housing and education).

> Monofonto© is the Font used in the Iconic retro-themed video game series Fallout, and was often paired with Futura in the series

It is *based on geometric shapes*, especially the circle, similar in spirit to the *Bauhaus* design style of the period.

* **Scala Sans** - FF Scala Sans is a humanist sans-serif typeface. Both upper and lower case are structurally modeled on serif old style faces. The lowercase *roman a and g are two-story*. FF Scala Sans *italics are true italics*, not sloped roman. The *lowercase a, e, v and y* are **particularly calligraphic**

It has the **warmth of a Humanist** face, but the **Mechanical look** of a *Sans-serif*.

*Scala Sans'* mixture of features is particularly characteristic of a contemporary type design.

## Putting Type to Work

The fundamental objective of setting type is to give the type a visual form in type; and composition that supports and illucidates the meaning of the text.

There are a number of ways we can achieve this as Designers:

* **Controlling the space** around letters, words, lines, and blocks of text

* We can **visually reflect** the orginizational *logic of the text* by *using space* symantically; by *grouping things that go together*, and *separating things that don't*

* We can create heirarchy, visually reflecting those items which are most essential, so that the reader can easily orient themselves towards the most important points of information

* We can apply the traditional rules and conventions of typesetting to make type reading as smooth, refined, and symantically correct as possible

* Typography is as much about shaping the space around words and blocks of text as it is about type itself

In typography, there are principals governing how these spaces should relate to one another, and special terms related to them

### Typographic Space

* Generally Typeface creators aim to match the space between letters with the spaces within the letters when creating a typeface

* If you are using a typeface at a very low size, adding a little bit of tracking can make the text more readable, but generally, doing this to the font at normal to large sizes will make the text less readable, or at least less pleasant to look at.

* If you are using a very large size , you may want to reduce the tracking for better readability

* Upper-Case letters are designed to appear beside lower-case letters, and as such come with a lower relative tracking than the lowercase letters; therefore when using all capital letters to make a word, you generally should increase the tracking to make up for this in order to achieve the intended asthetic of the typeface

* **Kerning** is adjusting the space between two particular letters. This is often done for artistic purposes, or to match a few off-looking Capitals to the rest of the text at scale. Manual Kerning is rarely necessary for technical purposes as space abnormalities that would require manual kerning adjustments such as an "Av" combination, come pre-baked in modern typefaces and fonts.

* Line spacing is called **Leading** as reference to the piece of lead that used to be placed between horizontal lines on the printing press

* **Typeset** = *Size + Leading* and is of common use. This is expressed as *'Size/Leading'*.

For example, "The Typeset is 7/10" would mean the text is 7pt large, with 10pts of Leading

There is no formal rule for setting the leading of a Typeset, only the guiding goal of making it easy for the eye to follow.

It is known that disproportionate leading makes text harder to read, be it small and cramped, or large and spacious.

* **Line length** is measured by the average number of letters that fit on a line.

A good line length is a compromise between *long enough* that you don't have to continually change lines due to too few words, *but short enough* that your eyes don't lose the start of the next line when moving to it.

For a Page of Text, **66 characters per line** is often seen as the *sweet spot* for line length, though more or less still work; especially when considering the *variance* between *typefaces and typesettings*

Generally speaking, *longer Line Lengths* will *require more Leading*, which will help the reader's eyes flow from one line to the next.

* **Alignment** can be seen as a bit of a dual edged sword as if we choose **Left-Aligned**, then the typeface will have it's *native spacing preserved*, but it's right side will have **"Ragging"** which is the uneven endings of lines; On the other hand, **Justified** will perfectly center the text and make the beginnings as well as the endings uniform, however this comes at the cost of *irregular Tracking*

### Page Spacing

As Typographers, we have to train our eyes to see, as well as read space.

* The principle of **Proximity**: We tend to read things that are grouped, or closer together as *Related to Eachother*; and things that are further apart as *Less Related*

Take a Date that is placed between a category heading, and a paragraph: If it is closer to the heading, we will assume that the entire category is from the time period of this date.

If however we move the Date downwards towards the paragraph, we would then assume that this is a *section Header*, and that the following paragraph is instead from the time period of that date; whereby our Category is encompassing not only this section, but potentially more.

* **When spacing** *Headings, Sub-Headings, and Content* it is a good idea to do so in uniform as a multiple of the Leading

For example, a paragraph with a Typesetting of 9/12 having a space of 24pt between itself and the sub-header, with a space of 36pt between the sub-header and the header

This is often the difference between clear typography and confusing typography.

* **Indents** - Traditonally **1em in size**, and mapped to the **TAB** key; Intents *signify tactical divisions* in text, such as the beginning of a new thought at a Paragraph break

> Indents are only meant for subsequent paragraphs within a text, meaning the first paragraph of the text should NOT be Indented

* **Paragraph Breaks** when not being signalled with *Indents*, can also be *signalled with an empty line*, but you should **never use both** on the same paragraph

* **Greeking** is the term for taking dummy lines (Imagine a Black Hi-Lighter, or Censor bars), much in the same fashion one would take dummy text, and making prototype layouts with them to plan and test how the page will flow when completed

#### The Grid

* **The Gutter** refers to the width of the spacing between the grid colums of a layout

* **Apply Grids Through Reverse-Engineering First**: It is recommended to construct the layout without a grid at first to get the flow and feel down, and then come back to it and apply an appropriate grid, or construct one for the layout

Of course, a Grid is not always required, or appropriate for every project.

### Heirarchy

A good Heirarchy facilitates easy access and easy parsing by the reader, and so is essential.

Creating a good heirarchy makes usage of all Typographic techniques in order to make text and areas have the desired relational emphasis to one another, and to the page itself.

#### Typographic Conventions

* **Line Breaks** should happen in a form that *doesn't interrupt the reader's rythm*, and if a word needs to be broken with a **Hyphen** on a line break, it should be *done between syllables*

* One or Two letter words shouldn't be left hanging at the end of a line because due to the way that we read, our eyes will tend to disassociate them from the rest of the text

* Single words or parts of words should not be left on their own upon a new line at the end of a paragraph

* Single lines, or the first line of a New Paragraph should not be left at the bottom of a page.
These lines are known as **Orphans**.

Similarily, the last line of a paragraph that is appearing at the top of a new page is called a **Widow** and is also to be avoided.

* When our text has a **Rag**, it is the most pleasing to the eye when it's *unevenness is presented in an even way*, like the teeth of a comb.

A **Rag** that is *too even* is *distracting* because it is almost even, but not quite; and a *wildly uneven* **Rag** is *distracting* because it is *not uniform* and creates potentially distracting shapes.

* Sometimes you will be able to get the **Rag** to look good by just adjusting the *Typesettings* and *line length*, but usually you'll end up **"Doing the Rag"** as designers say; which is to *manually* create your own *line breaks* to make the text look good

* A **Dash** or *Standard Dash* is the same symbol as the mathematical minus symbol on the keyboard, and is used for contractions such as "Left-Wing" and "Worn-Out"

* An **en dash** is half the size of an em, and is used to signify a range, such as Sep 4-8

* An **em dash** is used like a comma, setting a phrase apart in text; or to attribute an author --John Doe

> The keyboard's 'dash' is the mathematical minus symbol and is neither an en or an em dash, and their use will have to be done through the tools of an editor, or using "alt+ codes". The incorrect usage of dashes is quite common in type due to this fact, and is something designers "love to nit-pick"

* **Foot and Inch VS Quotation Marks** is a common issue that you'll hear about from designers.

**Foot and Inch Marks** *look linear*, as opposed to **Quotation Marks** which have the look of *"Sixty Six and Ninety Nine"*, and it is the *former* that are *found on standard keyboards*.

* Typefaces come with *Two sets of Number Figures*: **Lining Figures** run flush with the bottom and the top of the line height, and **Old-Style Figures** conform to X-Height and should be used with lower-case letters, as they have ascenders and descenders

* Typeface Numerical figures also often come in both *Proportional* and *Tabular* versions. Proportional versions are like standard text, and will vary in individual size as bound by their Key-Height, and Tabular(or Monospaced) versions will be sized to maintain the same amount of white space in between letters

* **Tabular** versions of Numerical Figures are useful in applications such as mathematical equations and spreadsheets, where you need the numbers to line up vertically in uniform

* **Small Caps** are sets of Capital Letters often included in Typefaces that conform to X-Height rather than Line-Height.

*Small Caps* are for use anywhere that words of *All-Caps* are used in the text, such as *in acronyms*; The exception being People's initials, which should always appear in standard Upper-Case Capitals

* **Ligatures** are two typefaces that are linked together into a single character (sort of looking like chunks of Elvish from LotR) and are meant for adding a degree of "polish" to your text, such as the liguatures that link together "F+L", and "F+I" replacing the corresponding letters in the words "fire flower" to give the sentence more of an artisan look and feel

<br>

## Making Meaningful Type

What attributes of typeface are shared with our medium, and can we begin with an easily identifiable list of these?

* **Train Engines(A Train Engine parts company)** = Mechanical = Industrial = Uniform, Forumlaic, Rigid = A Type of **Geometric Sans-Serif** +
Train = Large + Fast = **Bold and Italic** + Strong = **All Caps**

* **Designer Furniture** = Luxurious + Sturdy + Functional + Classic = **Modern Serif** paired with **Old Serif** names for classic pieces of furniture such as the "*Louise* Armoir"

* **SpacePen Under-water Pens** = Futuristic, Utilitarian, Uniform, Artistic = **Geometric Serif**

Finally, apply Artistic Licence and graphics to the Type.

Was it featuring a building? Try turning the text into a 3D vertical rectangle to mimic the looks of one.

Was it about flying? Try making some of the sujpporting words into clouds with the main title flying past them as if it were a plane.

This is what post-modern artistic typography is all about!

# Course 3 - Imagemaking

**Instructor:** Gail Swanlund

<br>

The difference between Art and Graphic Design in a nutshell, is that Graphic Design generally *Lives with Words*

An oil painting by itself is not Graphic Design, however making the oil painting and then applying it as the main piece in a poster, is.

As soon as we take our designs onto a book, or a two-page spread, that is the moment where Graphic Design occours; because as soon as you place an image onto a page or in proximity to one, or many other images; you're creating a relationship that contributes to the meaning, mood, and context of the scene.

 Now, think of this contextual control in the form of a magazine; how the experience changes from page turn to page turn depending on which scenes or combinations thereof come before or next, from cover to cover.

* **Establishing Heirarchy**: In Graphic Design, there are many ways this is achieved; Positioning(Central vs Sides), Contrast(Brightest vs dim), Color(vs grayscale), Size, Isolation(vs in a group), Depth(Closest vs Furthest), and any other texhnique used to achieve difference in juxtaposition, and combinations thereof

* **Heirarchy is Relational**, and is open to interpretation.

We, as designers use the techniques at hand to influence the viewer's interpretation.

* **Scale**: Using scale doesn't have to be a straightforward size comparison, but can be done relationally as well; such as a 10cm picture of a dime next to a 10cm picture of the Eiffel Tower

Although both are the same size, the only way that they will be viewed as such is if the viewer has no idea what these items represent in the real world.

Similarily with words, "Canyon" has a larger scale than "Mouse", and this is conveyed purely through meaning.

* **When making Books and Magazines** keep in mind that the front cover page will correspond to the back cover page, and likewise the first page of a book will correspond to the last page in a book once the pages are bound.

Some software may handle this for us, but if being done by hand using double prints (4 pages per double-wide piece of paper, which is then intended to be folded in half) we can fold a piece of paper into a little book and then number the pages to use as a correspondence aid, otherwise we will have to use math, being that the middle page is the (total number of pages / 2) and the corresponding page from the second half of the pages to any page from the first half is (the number of pages in the book - that first page's number + 1); for example, in a 10 page book pages 1 and 10 would be on one side of the first sheet of paper, and on the other side would be page 2 followed by page 19

# Course 4 - Ideas From the History of Graphic Design

**Instructors:** Louise Sandhaus and Lorraine Wild

<br>

* **Bauhaus (Baow-How-se)** was a highly influental post-WW1 (1920s) German school of Design that had the mission of bringing design into the new century where it would be integrated into the industrial revolution; "The integration of Art, Industry, and Design".

One could say that above and related to these things, that Industrial Architecture was the "focus" of this school, as the underpinning influence of it's artistic philosophy.

The school only existed for 14 years but because of it's premise and ideas, is still notorious throughout western design to this day.

> "Bau" is a derivitave of "Build"(Bauen) in German, which has for synonyms "build, construct, make", and "Haus" means House

Bauhaus was one of the first schools(if not the) to teach the use of industrial form in design, such as a logo design of face which is made entirely out of square shapes to represent uniform mass-production, paired with a modern geometric and proportional Typeface.

* **Square, Circle, and Cone** were seen as iconic representations of Bauhaus style design staples; the emphasis on geomotry equated to modernism, which was their aspiration

<br>

# Course 5 - Brand New Brand

**Instructor:** Michael Worthington

<br>

## Creating the Company

This is The Capstone Project for the specialization of Graphic Design, and here we will be creating a complete Brand Identity Package

> This is a Brand Identity Guide!
> It is a "Container" for our design process, but It is NOT an "Identity Manual"!  

<br>

### Logos And Marks (A Preface)

* Many companies will have both a **Lettermark** as well as a **Logo**; Nike for example.

The letter mark will often take on the air of having it's own custom typeface, and this is done through adjustments of the company's name itself only, rather than by comissioning an actual typeface.

* After selecting a Typeface for the company lettermark, bring it into an editor and play with the text to create something unique.

Maybe one of the letters is replaced entirely with a shape, or a hand drawing; maybe we add accents to all the vowels; maybe we make some parts of the text smaller than the rest.

We will eventually come up with something unique that is exclusive to our brand (does anyone else dot their "i's" and cross their "t's" like Walt Disney?)

<br>

### Background

* What does the company **Do**?

What are it's Goals?

* What is the company's **History**?

When was it founded?

What is it's philosophy?

What is it's backstory?

* What **Tone** should the company have? (Goofy, Serious, Generic, etc)

**Using and breaking down the instructor's examples:**

**For a Real Conservatory:**

* Classical/Contemporary Mix

Some sort of mixture of old and new, of tradition and modernity

* Advocating

Appeals to a wide audience(different cultural and economic backgrounds), friendly and not intimidating

* Inspirational

Uplifting, Musical, Crescendo, Humanist

* Educational

More serious than it is Flippant, Sincere, Scholarly

<br>

**For the instructor's Fake Business, a Snail Food Truck:**

* Gourmet

Fancy, classy, high quality, artisnal, meticulous, adventurous

* French

Cultured, cultivated, intellectual, arty, conversational, stylish

* Libertarian

Revolution, freewill, protest, independence

* Plodding

Quiet, slow, spacious, linear, static

<br>

### Naming the Company

This one will rarely have to be done, but may also apply to sub-branding and products.

Using the Adjectives from the History question, brainstorm a name using **Design Directions** derived from them.

For example, a singing food delivery service start up from someone who values comedy, speed and friendliness, might be looked at like:

Comedy = Laughing + Fun + Goofy, Speed = Cheetah + Wind + Race, Friendly = Super Hero + Cartoons + Dogs === "Laughing Super-Cheetah Delivery" or "Race Dog's Goofy-Grams" or "Toon-Town Funny wind-o-grams"

<br>

**The Name Game**

So how do we **move from a "base name" to a proper name?**

Examples:

* Blue Ribbon Sports = Nike

Nike came from the name of a Greek Goddess of victory

* Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory = Adidas

Adidas is a shortening of the name of one of the Dassler Brother's, Addi

* BackRub = Google

A "Google" is a number which is a 1 with 100 zeroes following it

**Why are these names Visually better?**

They are shorter and more concise, taking up less space; they look better Typographicly; Their shapes are within the focal point of our field of vision and easier to remember

<br>

* Make a **Mind Map** out of the Adjectives from the History of our Brand

Keep in mind that the further out you branch in a mind map the further you get from the core of your subject, but this is how we get from "search results" to "Google".

For example, "Founded in 1980" could extend it's branch in a mind map as such: 80s > Neon Colors > Glow in the dark paint; and from this branch maybe we decide to take "Glow" and use it for our brand.

Another example: "Optical Glass" > Lenses > Moulding > Melting > Sand > Fine Grains; and we decide to use "Fine-Grain Optics"

* Finally see if there is any **Play in the Words** from something from the map, such as the word "Escargot" from our instructor's map; it has "Car" and "Go" within the word, all of which relate to his food truck business

<br>

**Michael's top 3 names for his fake company are:**

* S-CAR-GO

Escargot + car + moving

* Revolution

Revolting + Liberty protest + Culinary revolution

* Snail Trail

Snails and the path the clow moving truck takes while selling them throughout the day

**Michael decided to go with "S-CAR-GO"**

<br>

### History and Inspiration

> History doesn't repeat itself, but it can rhyme - Mark Twain

Use history to your advantage here by making a spread of famous and successful brand images that relate to or came before your brand, to use as inspiration.

Here, Michael shows us a spread of Lettermarks and Logos used by various Conservatories and Orchestras that he had used when designing the branding for an actual conservatory.

* **Look at the details of what our predecessors and competitors used** such as the colors, typefaces, and their stylistic leanings

* **Create an Artistic Walk-through of your process:**

Build a Guide as you are developing the content for it, so we can show our design off as we build it. We aren't making a publication out of our background research here, but we are making a visual and texual representation used to show off the building process, and begin to sell our ideas.

As we come across our "finalists for inspiration" through our research, add them to the pages of our Company History to create a visual design that goes along with the evolution of our ideas for the brand through inspiration.

For example, maybe the History page gets a highly inspirational graphic from your resarch that is from the same founding year as the company; or maybe the Philosophy page gets a background picture that is representative of the top core-attribute that is associated with the company

<br>

### Creating a Logotype for the Company

Before rushing in and selecting typefaces, analyze the shapes of the letters of the word(s) that you will actually be working with:

* What sorts of different shapes can we make by changing the case of some/all of the letters?

* Can we add or remove any accents to improve the look?

What about hyphenating the word between syllables, and/or then substituting the hyphens for stand-in symbols such as dots or arrows?

* Is there an alternate arrangement of the word that is striking, such as a vertical orientation?

* **Uppercase/or Equal X-Height = Uniform** and likewise, Lowercase, or a Mixture will look more human and have more variance; creating a more playful shape

* **Letterform Variance:** would then different forms of select letters in particular improve the look, or speak to us in some way?

For example, our word has a lower-case 'a'; this letter has many different variations from one typeface to the next; could one of them add a flavor or attribute that we are after?

If our word is "fast", is there an 'a' that looks "faster" than others?

Another example: If our word is "grapes" and we want a playful feeling; can we find a "g" that has a large descender, and an "r" with a large ascender to create a look of variance?

What about the opposite to create a feeling of uniformity and congruence?

* **Mixing Typefaces for a Single letterform** is another tool that can be used here

What if we want to use a Sans-Serif typeface but add in a single Serif letter?

How about having every 2nd letter modern and geometric while having the others in Old-style Serif?

* **Initial Shape Considerations In summary:**

Look at the shape of the word(s), the shape of the individual letters, how the letters relate to one another, and what sorts of interesting shapes or looks might be created by altering the looks of one or all of the letters through various sifferent typefaces or individual alterations such as case, point-size or leading.

* **Making The Skeletons:**

What we want to do is to sort of "test drive" various iterations of our typeface finalists, along with whatever style ideas we may have; creating almost a large and controlled collage of potential ideas, none meant to be a choice as the final iteration, but all are meant to be stepping stones towards the image we want to find in our mind that will then become the final design.

* Different Typefaces

* Acronym arrangements

* Layouts and Styles

It's here that we should start "throwing ideas at our walls and seeing what sticks"

## Expand the Brand and Broaden Your Palette

### Adding Color

Aside from the considerations of color theory, are there any colors that come directly from our products, or images that we can pull from to use?

For example, Michael tried coloring his logo Green, and took that color directly from a photograph of an Escargot dish.

* **Look at your Color ideas from both the Positive as well as the Negative:**

We shouldn't only consider our logo in a particular color upon a black or white background, but also how does it look when it is itself black or white upon a background that is using the brand color?

We want to get a fit that looks good overall

> Make sure to test your colors as they will appear: RGB for digital applications and CMYK for printed; will you be needing versions of both?

### Adding a Mark/Icon (Logo)

In general, these marks are often pictoral, abstract, and non-typographic.

**Some Icons carry More Weight than Typography for a brand** such as Apple's apple, or Nike's swoosh; we don't really associate any particular type with the spelling of the company name as much as we do the icon.

This is a design choice that is ultimately up to design, and going with what works.

Should it be only one or the other, should it be both, should they carry equal weight?

Ask all of these questions on a case-by-case basis once the brainstorming is underway, and let the right flow reveal itself over time.

* Symbols, Marks and Icons often work best using **simple and geometric forms**, and also generally work in black and white while making use of the positive and negative space

Due to modern times eliminating the vast gap in expense of color vs grayscale print, we can now mainly design our logos with color in mind, as they will likely be displayed on a screen most often, though grayscale is still a consideration, and a design that transfers from color to black and white seamlessly is all the more better.

> You may want more than one iteration of the branding which are purposely meant to go together, such as with Michael's Conservatory example; One is meant to have the text and the logo completely separate, another has them integrated, and neither of these are making use of the Icon that was created.
> This works for them because their Primary Mark was just a stylized version of the first letter from the words of name "CCM" which allows their direct use as part of text. Of course, most companies do not do this, but if the shoe fits...

### Adding a Secondary Typeface

This helps to flesh out our palatte, and will give our expanded text items more of a voice for materials, and marketing.

Often a secondary typeface is just something that works well with the original typeface, but that doesn't mean that it has to be the same style or type.

* A secondary typeface can also be used to add another feeling to the brand that was not conveyed in the lettermark

For example, if we had wanted to convey elegance, but emphasized our simplicity instead; we could now go with a nice cursive typeface that will work well with our lettermark

* **Take your Secondary Typefaces for a Test-Drive:**

Pair them on screen with the Logo, the Lettertype as a paragraph or two and see how they work together, and also include and variants the typeface may come with (italic, bold, etc)

* See how the Secondary Typefaces work as Headings, Sub-Headings, Paragraph Text, Sub-Text, and across lines from eachother

* We are building a **Suite of Components** that we may not use all of the time

If one typeface pairs great with our brand, but only when used as a headline, then great we will keep it as long as that also pairs with what we decide to go with for our body type; and so on and so fourth.

Generally though, we should try to distill these choices down to a handful with a couple as the mains, and others there if we should need them, as 20 varying options is not working in favor of "brand congruency"

### Adding Imagery

We want to add a *Style of Imagery* to our design palette.

Will our brand most often be seen with Color Photography, 3D rendered art, or Crayon sketchings?

This is an artistic choice, but one that can be made to further the sense of brand congruency and recognition.

Our choice should relate to one of the aspects of our brand if possible, but nothing is set in stone.

For example, if "Traditional and Classic" are attributes of our brand, we may decide that most of our imagery should be old-style or historic black and white photographs.

### Adding a Secret Ingredient

This can be anything that you can make up yourself, anything extra that you'd want to add.

Often this is a **Rule for how your Identity System works**; it could be something modular, something that changes with application; but whatever it is it should make things more interesting

Michael decided to make 4 different variations of his snail logo, and assign each an application: One each for the Truck, the Company, The staff uniforms, and the Advertizements.

This could also take the form of something like "Always a Red background in print, and always Green on screen"; there are no rules here, until we make them.

* Sometimes these "flavor systems" can make a much larger long-term impact than we might think at first, such as with Google's 'Doodles' (Every week they change the letters that spell Google on their website to accomodate whatever the featured theme may happen to be)

* This is about coming up with some extra strategy that is going to make our company feel that little bit of special when compared with competitors

Maybe it gets a little more involved than just an alternate icon and needs a written description of how it's going to work, and maybe it has a list of rules; the sky is the limit.

## Apply Your Brand

It's time to take all of the pieces that you've made for your brand identity pallate and apply them to the pieces of collateral that will make up your brand.

Consider, which items will these peices be for this particular brand?

Some possibilities may include:

* Uniforms

* Accessories such as Bags, Bottles, Aprons and Pins

* Mugs, Glasses, Plates, Napkins

* Website Graphics

* Application Graphics

* Billboard Signage

* Poster Signage

* Building Signage

* Vehicle decals

* Banners

* Business printing materials

Then, **make a mock-up "demo package"** of these items.

These, *along with* a digital and/or printed **booklet of the Brand Identity Research examples**, plus the **Brand Identity Guidelines** can then be delivered to the client as a package
